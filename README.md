#  Decision Tree Classification Project

##  Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and Scikit-learn.
The goal is to build an interpretable machine learning model, understand how decision trees work, and evaluate performance using standard classification metrics.

This project is part of my hands-on learning journey in **Machine Learning and Data Science**, where I focus on building real-world, portfolio-ready projects.

##  Objective

* Understand the working of tree-based algorithms
* Perform data preprocessing and feature preparation
* Train and evaluate a Decision Tree model
* Interpret model performance using evaluation metrics

---

##  Dataset

* Structured tabular dataset used for supervised classification
* Contains input features and a target variable
* Preprocessed before model training (handling missing values, scaling if required)

---

##  Workflow

###  Data Preprocessing

* Loaded dataset using Pandas
* Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
* Prepared features (X) and target variable (y)
* Train-test split for unbiased evaluation

---

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Basic statistical overview
* Understanding feature distributions
* Identifying patterns relevant for classification

---

###  Model Building

* Implemented **Decision Tree Classifier** using Scikit-learn
* Trained model on training dataset
* Used default hyperparameters for baseline performance

---

###  Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification metrics (if applicable)

This helps understand:

* Model correctness
* Class-wise performance
* Overfitting tendencies

---

##  Key Learnings

* How Decision Trees make rule-based predictions
* Importance of train-test splitting
* Understanding model interpretability
* Basics of supervised machine learning workflow

---

##  Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (if visualizations included)

---

##  Results

* Successfully built and evaluated a Decision Tree model
* Achieved reliable classification performance on test data
* Demonstrated ability to implement end-to-end ML workflow

---

##  Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning (max_depth, min_samples_split)
* Compare with other models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
* Cross-validation for robust evaluation
* Deploy as a simple web app using Streamlit
